1. Files
This distribution contains the following files:
     a) README.txt: this file
     b) *.tgz: I/O trace files, described below
     c) md5_check.md5: output of md5sum for tgz files

2. I/O trace files
There are 216 I/O traces from a warehouse (also called a failure domain) of a production cloud block storage system (CBS). The traces are I/O requests from 5584 cloud virtual volumes (CVVs) for ten days (from Oct. 1st to Oct. 10th, 2018). The I/O requests from the CVVs are mapped and redirected to a storage cluster consists of 40 storage nodes (i.e., disks). 

More information about the CBS architecture is available from the ATC '20 paper titled "OSCA: An Online-Model Based Cache Allocation Scheme in Cloud Block Storage Systems". 

Each trace file is named as <date>.tgz.

The date format consists of year(4 char.), month(2 char.), day(2 char.), and hour(2 char.).

Here is an example file name.
2018-10-01-01.tgz
  - year : 2018
  - month : 10 (Oct.)
  - day : 1st
  - hour : 1 AM

3. I/O trace file format
The files are compressed comma-separated text files leveraging "tar" command. The fields in the files are:

Timestamp,Offset,Size,IOType,VolumeID

  - Timestamp is the time the I/O was issued.
    The timestamp is given as a Unix time (seconds since 1/1/1970).       
  - Offset is the starting offset of the I/O in sectors from the start of the logical virtual volume.
    1 sector = 512 bytes
  - Size is the transfer size of the I/O request in sectors.
  - IOType is "Read(0)", "Write(1)".
  - VolumeID is the ID number of a CVV.

4. Some suggestions on the use of the traces
In addition to using these traces to examine the issues discussed in the ATC '20 paper, they can be used to analyze:

	(1) the CBS access patterns of CVVs by dividing traces for each CVV using the VolumeID.
	(2) the architecture optimization of CBS by simulating the mapping of I/O requests to storage nodes.
